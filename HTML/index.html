                <p>
                    24 years old with a May birthday. I graduated in May 2021 with an Associate of (Computer) Science in Game Development 
                    from Columbus State Community College. I know C++ the best out of the languages I know, and Python will follow. I have experience with
                    Unity Game Engine, and have also used C# with Unity. I know 3D Modeling and Animation with Blender and
                    Autodesk Maya. I'm learning Godot Engine when I can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still deciding on what kind of software developer I would like to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hobbies include playing video games, learning guitar, and exercising. I'm currently playing <i>Final
                    Fantasy 14</i>, and <i>Age of Empires 2</i>. My musical inspirations are primarily <i>Arctic Monkeys, My 
                    Chemical Romance</i> and <i>Coheed and Cambria</i>. I enjoy pretty much everything except country, with 
                    some exceptions. My playlists currently include: <i>Doja Cat, Childish Gambino, Stone Sour, Slipknot, 
                    Coheed and Cambria, Crossfade</i>, and more than what I can think of right now.

                    The creature on the left is a Work In Progress (WIP) of a monster idea that I have. I call them the "Ant Eater".
                    There is a front and side profile, and from the side, you can see the face better. It looks kind of like an anteater (I guess?). 
                    The "Ant" is a reference to people, or other things that it may be bigger than. Supposed to be for an RPG project. I am 
                    still in the process of getting them 3D Modelled.

                    I am currently learning the Godot Engine to learn to make games. I have experience with Unity, and less so experience
                    with the Unreal Engine. I would like to learn more about Unreal, but I'm taking a break from Unreal, and learning Godot.
                    Godot was made in C++ and supports its own Python-like scripting language called "GDScript". I don't like Unity all
                    much anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently learning guitar/bass. I am using Rocksmith to help me learn and have fun, since I am more of a
                    "hands-on" and visual learner. And no, I will not show you what I have learned... at least not yet ;)
